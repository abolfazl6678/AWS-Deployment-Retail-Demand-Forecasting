# AWS-Deployment-Retail-Demand-Forecasting
This repository provides a production-ready retail demand forecasting system using a trained deep learning model in TensorFlow (https://github.com/abolfazl6678/Retail-Demand-Forecasting-DeepLearning) and an API developed by FastAPI, fully deployed on AWS using Docker, ECR, and EC2.
It allows users to send product/store features through an API and receive real-time demand forecasts over the internet.

## Tools & Libraries used
- **ML:** TensorFlow, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, joblib
- **API:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, pydantic
- **Cloud:** AWS EC2, AWS ECR
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## Model Input & Output Variables !!!!!!!!!!!!
The forecasting model uses structured retail data as input features to predict future product demand.
**Model Input Features**
The model receives retail store and product attributes as input features via the API in JSON format. These features are preprocessed and fed into the deep learning model to generate demand forecasts.

| Input Feature Name      | Description                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Date`                  | The specific day when the sales or demand data was recorded                                                 |
| `Store ID`              | A unique identifier for each store location                                                                 |
| `Product ID`            | A unique identifier for each product in the catalog                                                         |
| `Category`              | The classification of the product (e.g., electronics, toys, groceries)                                      |
| `Inventory Level`       | The number of products in inventory                                                                         |
| `Region`                | The geographical area where the store is located (e.g., North, South, West )                                |
| `Units Sold`            | The actual number of product units sold on the given date                                                   |
| `Units Ordered`         | The number of product units requested by the store or customers (may differ from units sold if out of stock)|
| `Price`                 | The selling price of the product per unit at the time of sale                                               |
| `Discount`              | Any reduction applied to the original product price (percentage or amount)                                  |
| `Weather Condition`     | Environmental factors such as sunny, rainy, which can influence demand                                      |
| `Holiday/Promotion`     | Indicates if the date coincided with a holiday, festival, or promotional campaign (binary )                 |
| `Competitor Pricing`    | Price of a similar product offered by competitors in the same region or market                              |
| `Seasonality`           | Cyclical or seasonal effects influencing sales patterns (e.g., Autumn, winter, spring)                      |

**Json format of Input Features** ????????????


**Model Target (Output Variable)**
This value is generated by the deep learning model after processing the input features.
| Output      | Description                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Demand Forecas`        | The predicted number of units expected to be sold                                               |

**End-to-End Flow**
Input Retail Features via api  ──►  Deep Learning Model  ──► Predicted Demand (units)
The trained model takes store/product/time/contextual features and produces a real-time demand forecast through the deployed API.
