# AWS-Deployment-Retail-Demand-Forecasting
This repository provides a production-ready retail demand forecasting system using a trained deep learning model in TensorFlow (https://github.com/abolfazl6678/Retail-Demand-Forecasting-DeepLearning) and an API developed by FastAPI, fully deployed on AWS using Docker, ECR, and EC2.
It allows users to send product/store features through an API and receive real-time demand forecasts over the internet.

## Project Overview !!!!!!!!
Accurate  product demand forcast is a critical challenge in retail supply chains due to its direct effect on lost sales if it is lower and excess cost due to overstocking if it is higher. In this project, I used  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), one of the main methods in Deep Learning, to predict daily product demandin retail stores.
**Business Insights:** Forecasting results provide actionable insights to minimize stock-outs, reduce excess inventory, and optimize replenishment planning.

---
## Project Objectives and assumptions !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Build a model to predict daily demand for each product 
- The model is built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - Deep Learning
- The model is trained by a dataset containing past sales, inventory levels, and product/store details given for each product in a given day
- **Modeling Assumption1:** Each day is treated as independent, allowing the task to be framed as standard supervised learning.
- **Modeling Assumption2:** Daily features (past sales, inventory, product/store attributes) are assumed to capture relevant patterns, removing the need for explicit time-series modeling.
- **Problem Formulation:** The model is formulated as a supervised regression problem, where daily product/store features are used to predict the expert demand forecast.
- **Frameworks:** The model is implemented using two major deep learning Python libraries: **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.
- **GPU:** The model is designed to automatically use GPU (if available) for faster training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Tools & Libraries used
- **ML:** TensorFlow, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, joblib
- **API:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, pydantic
- **Cloud:** AWS EC2, AWS ECR

## Model Input & Output Variables !!!!!!!!!!!!
The forecasting model uses structured retail data as input features to predict future product demand.
**Model Input Features**
The model receives retail store and product attributes as input features via the API in JSON format. These features are preprocessed and fed into the deep learning model to generate demand forecasts.

| Input Feature Name      | Description                                                                                                 |

| `Category`              | The classification of the product (e.g., electronics, toys, groceries)                                      |
| `Inventory Level`       | The number of products in inventory                                                                         |
| `Region`                | The geographical area where the store is located (e.g., North, South, West )                                |
| `Units Sold`            | The actual number of product units sold on the given date                                                   |
| `Units Ordered`         | The number of product units requested by the store or customers (may differ from units sold if out of stock)|
| `Price`                 | The selling price of the product per unit at the time of sale                                               |
| `Discount`              | Any reduction applied to the original product price (percentage or amount)                                  |
| `Weather Condition`     | Environmental factors such as sunny, rainy, which can influence demand                                      |
| `Holiday/Promotion`     | Indicates if the date coincided with a holiday, festival, or promotional campaign (binary )                 |
| `Competitor Pricing`    | Price of a similar product offered by competitors in the same region or market                              |
| `Seasonality`           | Cyclical or seasonal effects influencing sales patterns (e.g., Autumn, winter, spring)                      |

**Json format of Input Features** ????????????


**Model Target (Output Variable)**
This value is generated by the deep learning model after processing the input features.
| Output      | Description                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Demand Forecas`        | The predicted number of units expected to be sold                                               |

**End-to-End Flow**
Input Retail Features via api  ──►  Deep Learning Model  ──► Predicted Demand (units)
The trained model takes store/product/time/contextual features and produces a real-time demand forecast through the deployed API.
